- [lucid chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/e348323e-11f7-45a9-b830-77764936fdb8)

### Useful Resources
- I'll look into a dropbox/pocket/drive folder for dumping ideas


### In Progress/Future
1. Control Docker container
    - run cycle
        - [build image?]
        - start when called
        - run
        - shut down
        - [tear down image?]
2. Config file
    - specifications
        - managing ports/"pipeline"
    - building
3. dataduit wrapper
    - [dataduit container (API)]<-->[function(s)]
        - main "API"
            - traffic routed from program, through here, to functions

### Stretch considerations
1. Function scaling?
    - scale up testing functions when applicable?
2. Helpers for sending "lots" of data over the line -- multiple gzips
    - theory
        - shard set
        - sent in pieces
        - rebuild
