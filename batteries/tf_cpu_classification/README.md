tensorflow model generator from YAML config file.

- python container
- generate model for classification
- will need to be binary (sigmoid) and multi-class (softmax)
    - metrics will be different (top K vs standard)


## Python
- this looks promising? https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/
- https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/tags/
- tag
    - `1.3.0-py3`

## considerations
- CPU vs GPU (cuda image?)
